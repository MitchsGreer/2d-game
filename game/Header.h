//Things that can change
// - we dont need to display the player over the surface, this may be leading to some issues when the player moves back, 
//   it seems it will replace tiles with the default, in this case puddles. we can slove this by having a bool in the mapelement
//   that describes whether the player is on it or not, if it is, load the player
// - need to look through move, as it wot break the tiles even if you have all of the tools
// -
